I've always loved building products. Before I picked up coding, I used to record all my ideas using business plans and pitch decks. Then I started making games with my brother. We started a small studio with our friends called [Dissonance Entertainment](https://dissonent.com) and made [Mind the Trap](/mind-the-trap) and [Puppy Space Rescue](/puppy-space-rescue). At Dissonance I got a full-blown teaser for the product development process.

Over the next few years, I had really exciting opportunities to help companies build their products from the ground up. At Beach Day Studios, I created an [educational virtual reality coding game](/vcoder) and won the [2018 Oculus Launch Pad scholarship](https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-the-2018-oculus-launch-pad-scholarship-recipients/?locale=en_US).

For one summer, I launched a [Belgian waffle business](/motley-waffle-bar) at the Saturday farmers' market so I could learn how to manage a small business using the Square platform.

And most recently at Alibaba, I led the development for [Digiroma](/digiroma), a product web portal, and [Refinity](/refinity), a proprietary mixed reality shopping kiosk.

Currently, I'm building a social bookmark manager and a one-click trip planner.
