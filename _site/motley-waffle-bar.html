<p>Motley Waffle Bar was a specialty bakery shop that I ran at the Saturday farmer’s market in Hayward. I produced and sold Belgian waffles with pearl sugar. These were authentic waffles! The kind where the texture is bread-like and the chunks of sugar give a nice crunch when you bite into them.</p>

<p>Motley was a really fun summer experiment. I was just so curious about running a brick-and-mortar shop using the Square platform. I also wanted to interface more with customers. And what better way to do that than selling waffles at the farmers’ market.</p>

    <img src="/images/projects/motley-waffle/IMG_9102_Original.jpeg" />

</div>

<p>And the best part of it all? We had repeating customers! It’s such a good feeling when you’re doing it right.</p>

<h2 id="product">Product</h2>

<p>I opted for Belgian waffles because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They taste amazing.</li>
  <li>They’re perfect candidates for social media. You can put whatever toppings you want on waffles and it’ll look Instagrammable.</li>
  <li>They’re quick to make and prototype with different flavors.</li>
  <li>There are few stores in the Bay Area that sell them or even make them well. For example, Jamba Juice and Starbucks sell Belgian waffles but they taste like bricks.</li>
  <li>I could sell them as premium baked goods for higher margins.</li>
</ul>

<p>The COGS was about $1.20, and I sold the waffles for around $5, resulting in a profit margin of about 75%.</p>

<h2 id="branding">Branding</h2>

<p>I spent a lot of time on the brand. Should it be premium and rustic? Or should it be colorful, modern, and trendy? I played around with so many different styles to capture the right feel.</p>

<p>Given that it was a farmers’ market, attendees generally liked the farm-to-table feel. I eventually settled on a more rustic look. I chose a font that had edges resembling a waffle. And the logomark included an inset at the bottom to resemble the act of holding the waffle, which is how I wanted to sell it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/motley-waffle/logo_vertical_black.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For presentation, I used compostable paper plates and wooden sporks. The logo and prices were written with chalk on blackboards, and the toppings were stored in mason jars. The customers loved it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/motley-waffle/IMG_9182_Original.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>Using Square was a no-brainer. In fact, Square was the reason why I wanted to do this in the first place. I was so fascinated by how Square was empowering SMBs that I wanted to try it myself. Setting up a PoS on my iPad, using the card reader, and tracking my weekly sales were seamless.</p>

<p>For the website, I used <a href="https://carrd.co">carrd.co</a> to create a <a href="https://motleywaffle.carrd.co">simple landing page</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/projects/motley-waffle/landing page.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>I was curious how hard I could push the prices. Every Saturday I tweeked the price by $0.25 to $0.50. I wanted to see if I could hit $6, but anything above that would’ve been too much. Some of you might think I’m crazy for selling it at $6, but this isn’t an uncommon price point for premium baked goods in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, frequent raining made the attendee count fluctuate too much. And since there was no way for the market to count the amount of traffic, I couldn’t tell which price points were generating more revenue.</p>

<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>

<p>Because I wanted to make the waffles on-the-spot at the market, I was required to produce the raw goods in a commercial kitchen. I found an amazing family-owned commercial kitchen, which I rented for $300 a month. The most expensive equipment I purchased was a 6-quart KitchenAid mixer for about $250. The rest were standard.</p>

<p>On Thursday nights I would combine the materials and mold the dough to let it rise overnight. Then on Saturday mornings I would wake up at 4am to split the dough into smaller parts and let it rise a little more before the market opened.</p>

<p>Why the farmers’ market? Food is a highly regulated industry. If you ever plan on selling food, the farmers’ market is the cheapest and fastest way to get started.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overall, this was such a fun experiment, and I learned so much.</p>

<p>I can’t thank my wife and my family enough for their support.</p>
