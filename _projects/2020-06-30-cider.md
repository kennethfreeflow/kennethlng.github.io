Save links and share collections with your friends. Cider is a social bookmark manager that I'm currently developing using SwiftUI, React, and Firebase. 

The project is a WIP, and I will include screenshots soon. In the meantime, check out the project on Github.

I'm using SwiftUI for iOS, React for web front-end, Cloud Functions for server-side functionality, and Cloud Firestore for database.
