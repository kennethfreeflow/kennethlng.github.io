NMBO is a web app I created to make it insanely easy to make a checklist with others and get stuff done together.

1. Go to [https://nmbo.app](https://nmbo.app). 
2. Create a new checklist or open a previous one.
3. Copy the link and share it.

That's it! No account or download needed. Anybody with the link to the checklist can immediately start adding or completing tasks. 

## Stack

NMBO is made with React for the frontend, Next.js for server-side rendering, Bulma for the stylized components, and Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions) for the backend.
