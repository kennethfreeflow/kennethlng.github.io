[WhatsReopening.com](whatsreopening.com) is a community-driven website I'm currently developing to track places (establishments, geographic locations, and prominent points of interest), their current status, and when they're reopening during COVID-19.

## Stack

The website is built with React for the front-end and Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions) for the backend. I'm using Material UI for the UI framework. Location data, photos, and the map are powered by Google Maps API.
